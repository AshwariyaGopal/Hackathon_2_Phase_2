# Tailwind UI Components Expert

This skill specializes in the creation of a robust, accessible, and visually consistent UI component library using Tailwind CSS and React (Next.js) for "The Evolution of Todo". It focuses on mobile-first responsive design, theme compatibility, and reusable patterns to accelerate frontend development while maintaining high code quality.

## Core Capabilities

- **Reusable Component Patterns**: Designing and implementing modular components in `/frontend/components/` that promote code reuse and maintainability.
- **Atomic & Composite Components**: Expertise in creating foundational elements (`Button`, `Input`) and complex UI structures (`TaskCard`, `TaskList`, `TaskForm`, `Modal`).
- **Systematic Design Implementation**: Ensuring a consistent design system by strictly adhering to project-defined colors, spacing scales, and typography tokens.
- **Responsive & Mobile-First Design**: Leveraging Tailwind's responsive modifiers to ensure all components are fully functional and visually appealing across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- **Accessibility (A11y) Integration**: Building components with proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, focus state management, and keyboard navigation support.
- **Dark/Light Mode Compatibility**: Implementing theme-aware styling using Tailwind's `dark:` variant to provide a seamless user experience across different system preferences.
- **shadcn/ui Pattern Adoption**: Integrating or mimicking `shadcn/ui` patterns (Radix UI primitives + Tailwind) for advanced components like Modals, Popovers, and Command Palettes.
- **Standard Adherence**: Aligning all implementations with `frontend/CLAUDE.md` coding standards and `@specs/ui/components.md` requirements.

## Usage

Use this skill when developing new UI features, refactoring existing styles, or creating reusable layout elements. It provides the necessary guidance to ensure that every UI addition is performant, accessible, and fits perfectly within the overall aesthetic of the application.
