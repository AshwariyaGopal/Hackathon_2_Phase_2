## Prompt

/sp.tasks Todo Full-Stack Web App - Backend Complete Implementation & Frontend Integration (Phase II) ... (full description included)

## Response snapshot

Generated a detailed, dependency-ordered `tasks.md` for the backend implementation. Organized tasks into 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Stories (Secure Access, CRUD, Filtering/Sorting), and Polish. Ensured all tasks follow the required checklist format and include specific file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Actionable roadmap for implementing the backend with clear milestones and test criteria.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (Task generation phase)
- 📁 Files: `specs/002-backend-implementation/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` to start building the backend.
- 🧠 Reflection: Mapping entities and endpoints directly to user story phases ensures that each phase delivers a testable slice of functionality.
